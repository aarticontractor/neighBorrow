# Overview
#

## The Challenge:
### The project challenge is to create a collaborative MERN stack single-page application that addresses a real-world problem. The application should incorporate a scalable MongoDB back end, GraphQL API, Express.js and Node.js server, and React front end. It should also implement user authentication with JWT, utilize agile development methodologies, and adhere to high-quality coding standards. Additional suggestions include using CSS-in-JS or component libraries for styling and integrating the Stripe payment platform for payment functionality. The completed project should be added to the portfolio.
#

## Requirements for the Project:
### By following these instructions, you will be able to create an interactive MERN Stack single-page application that meets the project requirements and includes additional suggestions to enhance its quality and functionality.

- Start from scratch to revisit front-end abilities in the context of React and solidify understanding of working with multiple servers in a MERN application.
-  Use React for the front end.
- Use GraphQL with a Node.js and Express.js server.
- Use MongoDB and the Mongoose ODM for the database.
- Use queries and mutations for retrieving, adding, updating, and deleting data.
- Implement user authentication with JWT.
- Protect sensitive API key information on the server.
- Deploy the application using Heroku, ensuring that data is included.
- 10Create a polished UI that is mobile-friendly and responsive.
- Make the application interactive, accepting and responding to user input.
- Maintain a clean repository that adheres to quality coding standards, including file structure, naming conventions, best practices for class and ID naming conventions, indentation, and high-quality comments.
- Create a high-quality README with a unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and a link to the deployed application.
- Add the project to the portfolio created in Module 20.
- Consider implementing CSS styling options:
- Explore CSS-in-JS libraries like styled-components or Emotion.
- Use a component library such as Semantic UI, Chakra UI, or Ant Design.
- Create all CSS for the application using pure CSS.
* Optional: Consider integrating the Stripe payment platform for accepting payments or donations.
